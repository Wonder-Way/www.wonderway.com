<h4>What is SQL?</h4>
<br>• SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is
used for storing and managing data in Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS).
<br>• It is a standard language for Relational DatabaseSystem. It enables a user to create, read, updateand delete relational databases and tables.
<br>• All the RDBMS like MySQL, Informix, Oracle, MSAccess and SQL Server use SQL as their standarddatabase language.
<br>• SQL allows users to query the database in a
number of ways, using English-like statements.

What are the SQL?
SQL follows the following rules:
<br>• Structure query language is not case sensitive. Generally,
keywords of SQL are written in uppercase.
<br>• Statements of SQL are dependent on text lines. We can
use a single SQL statement on one or multiple text line.
<br>• Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the
actions in a database.
<br>• SQL depends on tuple relational calculus and relational
algebra.

<h4>What is SQL Process?</h4>
<br>• When an SQL command is executing for any RDBMS,
then the system figure out the best way to carry out
the request and the SQL engine determines that howto interpret the task. • In the process, various components are included.
These components can be optimization Engine, Queryengine, Query dispatcher, classic, etc.
<br>• All the non-SQL queries are handled by the classic
query engine, but SQL query engine won't handle
logical files.

<br>• High speed
<br>• No coding needed
<br>• Well defined standards
<br>• Portability

<h4>What is SQL Datatype?</h4>
<br>• SQL Datatype is used to define the values that a
column can contain.
<br>• Every column is required to have a name and datatype in the database table.
<h4>SQL Commands</h4>
<br>• SQL commands are instructions. It is used tocommunicate with the database. It is also usedtoperform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.
<br>• SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, adddata to tables, drop the table, modify the table, setpermission for users.

<h4>Types of SQL Commands</h4>
<br>• There are five types of SQL commands: DDL, DML,
DCL, TCL, and DQL.
Data Definition Language (DDL)
• DDL changes the structure of the table like creating atable, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.
• All the command of DDL are auto-committed that
means it permanently save all the changes in the
database.
<br>• Here are some commands that come under DDL:
 CREATE
 ALTER
 DROP
 TRUNCATE

database.
<br>• Here are some commands that come under DDL:
 CREATE
 ALTER
 DROP
 TRUNCATE
<br>Data Definition Language (DDL)- CREATECREATE It is used to create a new table in the database. Syntax:
REATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (COLUMN_NAME DATATYPES[,....]);
<br><h4>Example:</h4>
<br>CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);
CREATE It is used to create a new table in the database. Syntax:
REATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (COLUMN_NAME DATATYPES[,....]);
<h4>Example:</h4>
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);
Data Definition Language (DDL)- DropDrop: It is used to delete both the structure and recordstored in the table.
<br>Syntax:
DROP TABLE ;
Example:
DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;
Drop: It is used to delete both the structure and recordstored in the table.
<br>Syntax:
DROP TABLE ;
Example:
DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;
Data Definition Language (DDL)- ALTERALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This changecould be either to modify the characteristics of an existing
attribute or probably to add a new attribute. Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name COLUMN-definition;
ALTER TABLE MODIFY(COLUMN DEFINITION....);
<br>Example:
ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS MODIFY (NAME VARCHAR2(20));
ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This changecould be either to modify the characteristics of an existing
attribute or probably to add a new attribute. Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name COLUMN-definition;
ALTER TABLE MODIFY(COLUMN DEFINITION....);
<br>Example:
ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS MODIFY (NAME VARCHAR2(20));
Data Definition Language (DDL)- TRUNCATETRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and freethe space containing the table. Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
Example:
TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE;
TRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and freethe space containing the table. Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
Example:
<br>TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE;
<h4>Data Manipulation Language</h4>
<br>• DML commands are used to modify the database. It isresponsible for all form of CHANGES in the database.
<br>• The command of DML is not auto-committed that
means it can't permanently save all the changes in thedatabase. They can be rollback.
Here are some commands that come under DML:
 INSERT
 UPDATE
 DELETE

<br>Data Manipulation Language - INSERTINSERT: The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert
data into the row of a table.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (col1, col2, col3,.... col N)
<br>VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);
OR
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);
<br>Example:
INSERT INTO XYZ (Author, Subject) VALUES ("Sonoo", "DBMS");
<br>INSERT: The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert
data into the row of a table.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (col1, col2, col3,.... col N)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);
OR
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);
Example:
INSERT INTO XYZ (Author, Subject) VALUES ("Sonoo", "DBMS");
Data Manipulation Language - UPDATEUpdate: This command is used to update or modify the value of acolumn in the table.
Syntax:
UPDATE table_name SET [column_name1= value1,...column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE CONDITION]
<br>Example:
UPDATE students
SET User_Name =
'Sonoo'
WHERE Student_Id = '3'
<br>Update: This command is used to update or modify the value of acolumn in the table.
Syntax:
UPDATE table_name SET [column_name1= value1,...column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE CONDITION]
Example:
<br>UPDATE students
SET User_Name =
'Sonoo'
WHERE Student_Id = '3'
Data Control Language
DCL commands are used to GRANT and TAKE BACK
authority from any database user. Here are some commands that come under DCL:
Grant
Revoke
<br>DCL commands are used to GRANT and TAKE BACK
authority from any database user. Here are some commands that come under DCL:
Grant
Revoke
<br>Data Control Language - Grant
GRANT: It is used to give user access privileges to a database. Example:
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE TO SOME_USER, ANOTHER_USER;
REVOKE: It is used to take back permissions from the user. Example:
REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE FROM USER1, USER2;
GRANT: It is used to give user access privileges to a database. Example:
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE TO SOME_USER, ANOTHER_USER;
REVOKE: It is used to take back permissions from the user. Example:
REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE FROM USER1, USER2;
<br>Transaction Control Language
TCL commands can only use with DML commands like
INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only.
These operations are automatically committed in the
database that's why they cannot be used while creatingtables or dropping them.
<br>Here are some commands that come under TCL:
 COMMIT
 ROLLBACK
 SAVEPOINT
<br>TCL commands can only use with DML commands like
INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only.

 COMMIT
 ROLLBACK
 SAVEPOINT
<br>Transaction Control Language - COMMITCommit: Commit command is used to save all the transactions tothe database.
Syntex:
COMMIT;
Example:
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE AGE = 25;
COMMIT;
Commit: Commit command is used to save all the transactions tothe database.
Syntex:
COMMIT;
<br>Example:
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE AGE = 25;
COMMIT;
Transaction Control Language - RollbackRollback: Rollback command is
used to undo transactions that
have not already been saved
to the database. Syntex:
ROLLBACK;
<br>Example:
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE AGE = 25;
ROLLBACK;
<br>SAVEPOINT: It is used to roll thetransaction back to a certain
point without rolling back the
entire transaction. Syntex:
SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME;
Rollback: Rollback command is
used to undo transactions that
have not already been saved
to the database. Syntex:
ROLLBACK;
Example:
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE AGE = 25;
ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT: It is used to roll thetransaction back to a certain
point without rolling back the
entire transaction. Syntex:
<br>SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME;
Data Query Language
DQL is used to fetch the data from the database.
<h4>It uses only one command:</h4>
SELECT
a. SELECT: This is the same as the projection operation of
relational algebra. It is used to select the attribute based on
the condition described by WHERE clause. Syntax:
<br>SELECT expressions FROM TABLES WHERE conditions;
Example:
SELECT emp_name FROM employee WHERE age > 20;
